Quantum Threat Intelligence (QTI) is a cutting-edge cybersecurity framework developed by KeysGuard that leverages quantum-modeled correlation, threat signal entanglement, and probabilistic forecasting to detect and neutralize cyber threats before they manifest. Designed for national security, defense, and critical infrastructure environments, QTI redefines the boundaries of proactive threat intelligence.

## 🔐 Introduction

**Quantum Threat Intelligence (QTI)** is a next-generation threat detection and prediction paradigm that leverages principles of high-dimensional state modeling, probabilistic computation, and quantum-aware telemetry to anticipate and mitigate threats *before they manifest*.

Unlike traditional threat intel, which is reactive and pattern-based, QTI is **probabilistic, entangled, and predictive by design**.

## 🌀 Core Concepts

- **Quantum-Modeled Adversary Simulation**  
  Using high-dimensional feature vectors mapped onto a probabilistic surface to simulate attacker decisions before they occur.

- **Threat Entanglement™**  
  A theory proposing that multi-sourced threat signals — when fused across time, space, and entropy — can remain "entangled" across the kill chain lifecycle.

- **Q-Enhanced Correlation Engine**  
  Proprietary inference model that amplifies threat signal correlation across endpoints, behaviors, and metadata states using entropy-informed weighting.

- **Post-Quantum Detection Theory**  
  Foresight into adversarial capabilities leveraging post-quantum cryptographic weakness and behavioral anomalies introduced via quantum-class agents.

## 🧠 Why QTI?

> _“We don’t just react to threats. We model their existence before they enter the network.”_

Quantum Threat Intelligence is engineered for:
- National security environments  
- Autonomous threat defense  
- Complex system-of-systems environments (DoD, aerospace, zero-trust enclaves)  
- Advanced adversarial simulation

## ⚙️ QTI Architecture

**QTI Engine** (proprietary) sits at the core of:
- Real-time 3D Threat Visualization
- MITRE ATT&CK & D3FEND Overlay Models
- Live Behavior Forecasting Layer (BFL)
- Compliance + Threat Model Mapping

> 🧠 **Core engine algorithms remain confidential.**  
QTI is currently embedded within KeysGuard’s enterprise threat defense platform. Public APIs and visualization outputs are available for approved partners.
