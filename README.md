Quantum Threat Intelligence (QTI) is a cutting-edge cybersecurity framework developed by KeysGuard that leverages quantum-modeled correlation, threat signal entanglement, and probabilistic forecasting to detect and neutralize cyber threats before they manifest. Designed for national security, defense, and critical infrastructure environments, QTI redefines the boundaries of proactive threat intelligence.

## 🔐 Description

**Quantum Threat Intelligence™ (QTI)©** is a predictive cyber defense paradigm pioneered by KeysGuard that uses high-dimensional modeling, probabilistic computation, and signal entanglement to simulate, correlate, and neutralize cyber threats *before impact*.

> **"Because waiting for a breach is obsolete."**

---

## 🔮 Extended Definition

**QTI©** leverages quantum-modeled behavioral prediction, multi-domain entropy fusion, and adversarial simulation to push threat intelligence beyond reactive defense. It introduces a future-focused, preemptive methodology that aligns with the needs of national security, critical infrastructure, and next-gen cyber operators.

## 🌀 Core Concepts

- **Quantum-Modeled Adversary Simulation©**  
  Using high-dimensional feature vectors mapped onto a probabilistic surface to simulate attacker decisions before they occur.

- **Threat Entanglement™**  
  A theory proposing that multi-sourced threat signals — when fused across time, space, and entropy — can remain "entangled" across the kill chain lifecycle.

- **Q-Enhanced Correlation Engine©**  
  Proprietary inference model that amplifies threat signal correlation across endpoints, behaviors, and metadata states using entropy-informed weighting.

- **Post-Quantum Detection Theory©**  
  Foresight into adversarial capabilities leveraging post-quantum cryptographic weakness and behavioral anomalies introduced via quantum-class agents.
